To support the growth of the wine market, a way to qualify wine quality is needed to ensure consistency, and to potentially discover niche markets in order to diversify sales. The goal of this analysis is to model wine quality (sensory data) based on physicochemical attributes on the wine. A better understanding of the compents that make up high wine quality could aid in reproducability. This inforamtion would mostly be useful for wine experts and food scientists."
