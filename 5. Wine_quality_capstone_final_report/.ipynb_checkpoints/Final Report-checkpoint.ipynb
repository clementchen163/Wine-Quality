    "Wine consumption is prevalent across multiple cultures. Here we examine the red and white wines from the vinho verde region of Portugal. To support the growth of the wine market, a way to qualify wine quality is needed to ensure consistency, and to potentially discover niche markets in order to diversify sales. The goal of this analysis is to model wine quality (sensory data) based on physicochemical attributes on the wine. A better understanding of the compents that make up high wine quality could aid in reproducability. This inforamtion would mostly be useful for wine experts and food scientists."

Each sample is for one wine and includes objective laboratory tests such as density or alchohol content as well as a quality rating from 0(bad) to 10(fantastic) obtained from the median score of at least 3 wine experts.

This makes me believe that if the data collection process is robust, it is very unlikely that two unique wine samples coincidently have the same feature values. Could it be that these duplicates are the same wine samples but have had multiple different people evaluate its quality? According to the data source: \"the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts)\". This lets us conclude that the duplicates are true duplicates and should be removed prior to modeling."

For distance based metrics, it is  imporant that data is scaled so that one feature doesn't drown out others simply by having higher absolute values. RobustScaler is robust to outliers so should be used over StandardScaler. However RobustScaler turns some values negative which is inconsistent with our features which are pH, % alchohol by volume, and densities of various chemicals which can only have non-negative values. To remedy this, a MinMaxScaler is applied ontop to make minimmum and maximum values 0 and 1 respectively. "
