Each sample is for one wine and includes objective tests such as density or alchohol content as well as a quality rating from 0(bad) to 10(fantastic) obtained from the median score of at least 3 wine experts.

    "* **Problem:**  With 1177 rows of duplicated data, deciding what to do with them is not trivial. Of the features we have, none are categorical and with the exception of pH, all are continuous. This makes me believe that if the data collection process is robust, it is very unlikely that two unique wine samples coincidently have the same feature values. Could it be that these duplicates are the same wine samples but have had multiple different people evaluate its quality? According to the data source: \"the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts)\". This lets us conclude that the duplicates are true duplicates and should be removed prior to modeling."

We can see that between red and white wines, there seems to be a greater representation of white wines in the higher 6,7,8,9 quality categories while 80% of red wines lie in the 5,6 quality range. This signifys that the quality of red and white wines are not distributed the same so training two seperate models would be beneficial."
